1. What data types do each of these values represent?
  1. String or VARCHAR
  2. Integer or INTEGER
  3. DATE
  4. Float or DECIMAL
  5. If you’re not including the ‘$’ sign, Float. SQL has a MONEY datatype for currency.

2. Explain in your own words when a database might be used. Explain when a text file might be used.
  A database can be used for so many things… like a calendar, budget, attendance, user information, movie times, etc.
  A text file can be used for documentation, a ReadMe file, your diary, this assignment, etc.

3. Describe one difference between SQL and other programming languages.
  SQL is declarative. Most languages I’ve used up to this point are procedural.

4. In your own words, explain how the pieces of a database system fit together at a high level.
  The pieces of a database relate to one another based on values in columns and rows.

5. Explain the meaning of table, row, column, and value.
  A table is made up of rows and columns occupied by values.
  Each row represents an object in a table.
  A column divides each value type.
  A value is what occupies the intersection of rows and columns and includes things like dates, payment amounts, usernames, etc.

6. List 3 data types that can be used in a table.
  Integer, Float, String  - or are you asking for SQL specific datatypes? In that case: INTEGER, VARCHAR, DATE

7. Given this payments table, provide an English description of the following queries and include their results:
  The first query is asking for all dates and amounts contained in the table payments:

  date				              amount
  2016-05-01T00:00:00.000Z	1500.0000
  2016-05-10T00:00:00.000Z	37.0000
  2016-05-15T00:00:00.000Z	124.9300
  2016-05-23T00:00:00.000Z	54.7200

  The second query is asking for amounts that are greater than 500 from the table payments:

  amount
  1500.0000

  The third query is asking for all value types (i.e. from all columns) in the payments table where the payee = Mega Foods:

  date				              payee		    amount		memo
  2016-05-15T00:00:00.000Z	Mega Foods	124.9300	Groceries

8. Given this users table, write SQL queries using the following criteria and include the output:
  The email and sign-up date for the user named DeAndre Data:

  SELECT email, signup
  FROM users
  WHERE name = 'DeAndre Data';

  email			        signup
  datad@comcast.net	2008-01-20T00:00:00.000Z

  The user ID for the user with email 'aleesia.algorithm@uw.edu':

  SELECT userid
  FROM users
  WHERE email = 'aleesia.algorithm@uw.edu';

  userid
  1


  All the columns for the user ID equal to 4:

  SELECT *
  FROM users
  WHERE userid = 4;

  userid	 name		         email			        signup
  4		     Brandy Boolean	 bboolean@nasa.gov	1999-10-15T00:00:00.000Z
